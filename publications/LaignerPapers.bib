  title     = {From a Monolithic Big Data System to a Microservices Event-Driven Architecture},
  abstract  = {[Context] Data-intensive systems, a.k.a. big data systems (BDS), are software systems that handle a large volume of data in the presence of performance quality attributes, such as scalability and availability. Before the advent of big data management systems (e.g. Cassandra) and frameworks (e.g. Spark), organizations had to cope with large data volumes with custom-tailored solutions. In particular, a decade ago, Tecgraf/PUC-Rio developed a system to monitor truck fleet in real-time and proactively detect events from the positioning data received. Over the years, the system evolved into a complex and large obsolescent code base involving a hard maintenance process. [Goal] We report our experience on replacing a legacy BDS with a microservice-based event-driven system. [Method] We applied action research, investigating the reasons that motivate the adoption of a microservice-based event-driven architecture, intervening to define the new architecture, and documenting the challenges and lessons learned. [Results] We perceived that the resulting architecture enabled easier maintenance and fault-isolation. However, the myriad of technologies and the complex data flow were perceived as drawbacks. Based on the challenges faced, we highlight opportunities to improve the design of big data reactive systems. [Conclusions] We believe that our experience provides helpful takeaways for practitioners modernizing systems with data-intensive requirements.},

  title     = {A Systematic Mapping of Software Engineering Approaches to Develop Big Data Systems},
  abstract  = {[Context] Data is being collected at an unprecedented scale. Data sets are becoming so large and complex that traditionally engineered systems may be inadequate to deal with them. While software engineering comprises a large set of approaches to support engineering robust software systems, there is no comprehensive overview of approaches that have been proposed and/or applied in the context of engineering big data systems. [Goal] This study aims at surveying existing research on big data software engineering to unveil and characterize the development approaches and major contributions. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study, identifying 52 related research papers, dated from 2011 to 2016. We classified and analyzed the identified approaches, their objectives, application domains, development lifecycle phase, and type of contribution. [Results] As a result, we outline the current state of the art and gaps on employing software engineering approaches to develop big data systems. For instance, we observed that the major challenges are in the area of software architecture and that more experimentation is needed to assess the classified approaches. [Conclusion] The results of this systematic mapping provide an overview on existing  approaches to support building big data systems and helps to steer future research based on the identified gaps.},
